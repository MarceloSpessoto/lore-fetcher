# Introducing `lore-fetcher`

`lore-fetcher` is a tool for integrating CI infrastructure with mailing lists in a kernel pre-submission
build context. It provides a range of different features that aim to aid the use of regular CI tools like
Jenkins in a kernel context, i.e., a contribution environment based on mailing lists.
